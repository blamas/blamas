# Hey, I'm Theo (blamas)

I work as an SRE at Swan.

I like to automate everything I can get my hands on. IaC provisioning, CI/CD and observability setups with metrics, logs, traces, and useful alerts. Performance, networking and resource consumption are always part of the design discussion.

I am also into open source and hardware. Outside of day-to-day platform work, I spend time on homelab builds, hardware prototyping, and microcontroller projects.
